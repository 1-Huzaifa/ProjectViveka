            "TITLE WOULD BE: BG-C12-Theme1-Shobana   My pranams to all Atmajyotis. Divine light of the self,we are looking at the key theme of chapter 12. Bhakti yoga Bhagawan has told how to do service gyanaformukti. Now his outline he is giving detailed characteristics of a devotee bhakta. Most of us have a concept of bhakti  concept of devotion   offering some doing some ritual,offering a flower  lighting a lamp, or doing namaskara.  This we call bhakti. Why do we, people do rituals? They will do out of fear. If I don’t do this something bad can happen to me.They may do out of desire. If we do this something better may happen. Bhakti spoken here is none of these. Bhakti spoken of here by Bhagawan is pure devotion. The desire to realise Bhagawan is pure devotion. Way for that is to do service to living beings. Seeing Bhagawan in all living beings is the way. So what are the characteristics of such a devotee? In  the world where they come as a person, by what he has Oh! He has a car he has a house, he has a name and he has fame. A recognition in the world. The world recognises by what you do .Oh this guy has done this  the achievement. But Bhagawan recognises by  not what you do or  what you have. He recognises by what you are. The devotee character recognised by Bhagawan is outlined here. Now there are 7 characters around 39. The list of 39 is  you to be aware“O” you are a devotee or not This for your own understanding where you stand. Ok Its a self  check list. If you have some qualities, very good develop on that if you dont have Those qualities work towards that. That is the purpose why Bhagawan is telling these qualities. Are you clear? First and foremost quality,” Adveshtha srava bhutanam” No enmity to any living being” Mytraha”Friendliness with everybody. “Karuna” compassion, “Samadukha” “sukhadukha” balanced state of mind in happiness and unhappiness. “Kshami” forgiveness. “Nirahankara” no ego. “Santushtaha” happy all the time. “Yadatma dhrudhanishchaya” involves meditation. Controlling sense organs and mind engages in meditation on Bhagawan. “Anapekshaha” not expecting anything from anybody. “Suchihi” purity not only external purity but mental purity.\n",
            "“Dakshaha” Dakshaha means not laziness anything he does, does it efficiently also efficient in doing also of course Efficient in life also efficient in spiritual sadhana. Okay doing right sadhana taking  right path. Gatamgataha no sorrows left. He is free from sorrows. Sarvasanga parityagi. He has no desire.  Other than realising God. All of us work for some de sire. So the only purpose is to realise God. Is the motivation. “Shubhashubha Parityagi” something good happens ,Shubhashubha parityagi means some we do some good karma good result will come  and bad karma we get  bad result. All good results come, bad results come  All are gift from God. accept with equanimity.  “Nasprashyati Nadrishti”He does’nt get elated with  joy he no enmity for anybody. “Nasochyati” Don’t ever get depressed. “Nakaankshati” doesn’t crave for something. Such a devotee is closest to me/him.” Sama Shatrocha Mitrecha” the friend and enemy is same What it means is,seeing the divinity in friend and enemy. “Tatha Manapamanayoho”  Mana means Somebody honour’s you apamana means somebody dishonour ’s syou, equanimity of mind in mana and apamana” Sheethoshna Sukha Dukheshu” extreme heat and pressure we face circumstances like, Where we get pain and ache, he gives example cold and heat extreme conditions apply , people get agitated when extreme condition is applied.One day it is cold he says Oh God horrible cold. He gets, starts getting external cold inside.Very agitated Accepting all conditions applied by equanimity. “Sama Sangha vivarjithaha”no attachment to anything. “Thulyaninda Sthitirmouni” Somebody praises you, somebody denounces you, somebody blames you, be silent , peaceful. Everything comes in life. He is happy. He is peaceful.He accepts anything happening in life like Prasada from God. With understanding that anything happening  in life at given point of life is result due to karmaphala. There is nobody to blame. You have to accept what you have done as gift from the universe. Whatever comes in life, he is satisfied. “Aniketaha” one who is[ Niketa means attachment to body, mind, and intellect] One who is detached and free from attachment to body, mind , and intellect. So some of these are qualities of a devotee. These qualities are told by Bhagawan, to tell you, he looks at these qualities of a devotee and not what you do. What you do is the result of these qualities.\n",
            "889\n",
            "But people who have done mistakes, on devotion based on what do, will doubt but Bhagawan will see what are the inner qualities of devotee behind the action. So these are some of the qualities which you get in your life. If you have them its very good if you don’t have them develop them. That is the purpose of the chapter of Bhakti Yoga. May all develop the devotion   The in God. to devotion to service, seeing devine in every human being. Lord through Yagna. May all develop Bhakti and Jnana. May all develop the highest qualities of Bhakti and Jnana that Bhagawan has outlined.\n"
